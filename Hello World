In order to deploy my app, I started an HTML project with the intention of hosting it online. I committed the project to a GitHub repository and enabled the GitHub Pages function, which automatically deployed the website and generated a web address. A challenge I encountered in the process was finding the settings where I would need to enable the GitHub Pages function. Another challenge I encountered was ensuring the file had the correct title so that the page would open correctly. Cloud hosting is important to my project as it allows all students to use the project from the cloud without having to download anything from the cloud.
